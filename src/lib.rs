//! Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency (RTIC) framework for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers
//!
//! **HEADS UP** This is an **beta** pre-release; there may be breaking changes in the API and
//! semantics before a proper release is made.
//!
//! **IMPORTANT**: This crate is published as [`cortex-m-rtic`] on crates.io but the name of the
//! library is `rtic`.
//!
//! [`cortex-m-rtic`]: https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m-rtic
//!
//! The user level documentation can be found [here].
//!
//! [here]: https://rtic.rs
//!
//! Don't forget to check the documentation of the `#[app]` attribute (listed under the reexports
//! section), which is the main component of the framework.
//!
//! # Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
//!
//! This crate is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.36 (2018 edition) and up. It *might*
//! compile on older versions but that may change in any new patch release.
//!
//! # Semantic Versioning
//!
//! Like the Rust project, this crate adheres to [SemVer]: breaking changes in the API and semantics
//! require a *semver bump* (a new minor version release), with the exception of breaking changes
//! that fix soundness issues -- those are considered bug fixes and can be landed in a new patch
//! release.
//!
//! [SemVer]: https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html
//!
//! # Cargo features
//!
//! - `heterogeneous`. This opt-in feature enables the *experimental* heterogeneous multi-core
//! support. This feature depends on unstable feature and requires the use of the nightly channel.
//!
//! - `homogeneous`. This opt-in feature enables the *experimental* homogeneous multi-core support.
